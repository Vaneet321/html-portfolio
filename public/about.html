<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Vaneet Thakur, a passionate web development learner based in India. With a keen eye for detail and a deep love for programming, I strive to create work that not only meets the brief but also tells a compelling story.</p>

<p>My journey began a few days back finding knowledge about Angela Yu's Web Development course, and since then, I've been dedicated to my learner's journey.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in my Web Development learning, you can find me playing video games, travelling and watching critically acclaimed films.

This website is dedicated to my development portfolio and project links. Reach out to me for notable suggestions or important queries. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
